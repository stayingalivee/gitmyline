# gitmyline README

Ever wanted to send a reference link to your coworker about a particular line of code? if yes, what
did you have to do? you  had to go to your internal version control be it github or gitlab, you had to navigate to your organization's space then to that particular project, you had to double check the file's path and then you click and click till you reach the file, you probably had to also check the line number to highlight it so you can fiiinaly copy the URL. I hate it, you hate it.

If this frustrates you like it frustrates me then this vscode extenstion is for you! with one click this extension will do all the above and open a new tab on your browser with the the line your cursor is currently at highlighted for you!

## TODO
- [ ] add linux support
- [ ] add windows support

**Enjoy!**
